# ghibli-app
Collaborated with Kirsty Brewer to create an app for fans of Studio Ghibli to explore their favorite films and characters.
For this application we invocated various loop mechanisms for effective and accurate results based on set conditions.  We also executed multiple callback functions through the invocation of JS event listeners on specific nodes.  For the backend, we designed the database schema and DB logic while applying complex Gems to enhanced UI experience.  In order to deliver fast and engaging site to users, we applied the application of fetch() and the AJAX techniques.
